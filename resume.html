        <h1>Marcella Mendes | Graphic Designer</h1>
      </div>

        <p>Hi, my name is Marcella Mendes and I'm currently working on getting my AAS in Graphic Design and Advertising.
          This course has already provided me with a lot of basic knowledge on how to become a professional in the field.
          With this course I was able to learn how to create logos, how to brand a company, how to create a website for the company, among other things.
          I hope that at the end of this course I can have a job opportunity so that I can use all the tools I have learned throughout this course.
        </p>
